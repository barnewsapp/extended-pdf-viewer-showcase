## Prequisites and announcement

You can get the PDF viewer up and running in roughly two minutes. You need node.js, npm and a current version of Angular. This library aims to be compatible to the last four version of Angular, which gives you two years time to update.

*Important:*
The current version requires at least Angular 12. If you're using an older version of Angular, you can use older versions of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer. However, only the newest version is supported. I don't maintain older versions.
