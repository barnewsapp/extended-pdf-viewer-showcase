## Prequisites and announcement

You can get the PDF viewer up and running in roughly two minutes. You need node.js, npm and a current version of Angular. This library aims to be compatible to the last four version of Angular, which gives you two years time to update.

*Importantant:*
The current version requires at least Angular 9. If you're using an older version of Angular, please use ngx-extended-pdf-viewer 8.x. However, that's a version I don't support. Bug fixes and new features always go into the current version.
