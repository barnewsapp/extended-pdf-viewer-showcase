1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of your project.
2. Run this command and accept the defaults:
```
ng add ngx-extended-pdf-viewer
``` 
3. Add the new component `<app-example-pdf-viewer>` to your `<app-component>` to display the PDF file.

After that, you'll probably want to delete the example PDF file and move the code out of the example component.
